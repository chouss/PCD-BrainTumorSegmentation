## Brain Tumor Segmentation using Fine-Tuned nnU-Netv2

This project aims to improve brain tumor segmentation using a fine-tuned version of the nnU-Netv2 architecture. By leveraging deep learning and medical imaging (MRI), we enhance the accuracy and reliability of tumor detection and segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated on the BraTS 2020 and BraTS 2021 datasets, using both standard and ResEnc nnU-Net configurations.

We also introduce ensemble methods—Max Probability and Probability Averaging—to combine outputs from different models, achieving smoother and more precise segmentation results.

A simple, user-friendly interface has been developed to make the model accessible to healthcare professionals, enabling quick MRI analysis and tumor visualization.
